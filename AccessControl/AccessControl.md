## 🔐 Access Control

Access control is the swift feature that controls where a **type,** **property,** or **function** can be seen and used in your codebase and module.

Access control let you,
- **Hide implementation details** so callers only see the API surfacem not internals.
- **Protect modules and files** from accidentally using things that should stay private.
- **Design clear public APIs** for frameworks/libraries while keeping helpers internal.
